# Why Testing?

We want to answer the question does my code works?
If we don't write tests in our code, we will manually verify the behaviour of our application, this is costly.

If we don't test we may found that the application or parts of the application does not work.

## Test my code after changes.

Simply because I test my code previous to some change, doesn't mean that it will continue working. This is called Regression and its a common problem in software development.

## Refactoring.

When the behaviour of a function does not change but is rewrite to be more efficient, the previous test ensure it works as expected, **Refactoring** when you have tests implemented becomes more cheap and safer.

## Cost.

Fixing bugs in production are very cost.
